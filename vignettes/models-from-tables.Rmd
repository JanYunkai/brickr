## Getting started

The `bricks_from_*` series of functions creates 3D models of LEGO bricks from a variety of input formats. These models are rendered using [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall)'s [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) package. This package must be installed.

`bricks_from_table()` converts a matrix-shaped table of integers into LEGO bricks, where most columns are x-coordinates, rows are y-coordinates, and a special `Level` column denotes the elevation of the row. For simple models, this table can be made manually using `data.frame()` or `tibble::tribble()`. 

For more advanced models, it's recommended you use MS Excel or a .csv file. `bricks_from_excel()` is a wrapper function to more easily build models designed using a Microsoft Excel template. Please see this repo: [brickr toybox](https://github.com/ryantimpe/brickr_toybox).

Pass the output of any `bricks_from_*()` function to `build_bricks()` to render it as a 3D model.

## Individual bricks

Create a single 2x4 brick with a 2x4 data frame, with an additional column to specify the 'Level'. These can be letters or numbers.

```{r bricks_1, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
#This is a 2 (columns) x 4 (rows) brick
(brick <- data.frame(
  Level="A",
  X1 = rep(3,4), #The number 3 is the brickrID for 'bright red'
  X2 = rep(3,4)
))

brick %>% 
  bricks_from_table() %>% 
  build_bricks(brick_res = "hd") #Bricks available in standard def, high def, and ultra hd. 

rayshader::render_snapshot( clear = TRUE)
```

Stack many bricks by changing the 'Level' value in the data frame. The script below uses `purrr::map_df()` to avoid copying and pasting. Changing the numeric values inside the data frame for each level creates different colors.

```{r bricks_2, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
1:10 %>% 
  purrr::map_df(~dplyr::mutate(brick,
                        Level = LETTERS[.x], 
                        X1 = .x,
                        X2 = .x)) %>% 
  bricks_from_table() %>% 
  build_bricks(brick_res = "hd")

rayshader::render_snapshot( clear = TRUE)
```

## Full models

The most direct way to create a 3D model is to manually create a data frame. Below, we create a data frame using `tibble::tribble()` so we can more easily see the structure as it's written.

The data frame has 3 numbers as input (values of 0 are void spaces in the model). Rather than use the default brickr colors for the values of 1, 2, and 3, we define another data frame 'brick_colors' 

```{r bricks_5, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
tree_or_mushroom <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Level, ~X1, ~X2, ~X3, ~X4, ~X5, ~X6,
  "A", 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
  "A", 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
  "A", 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
  "A", 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
  "B", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
  "B", 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0,
  "B", 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 
  "B", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
  "C", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
  "C", 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0,
  "C", 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 
  "C", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
  "D", 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 
  "D", 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0,
  "D", 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 
  "D", 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0,
  "E", 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 
  "E", 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0,
  "E", 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 
  "E", 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0,
  "F", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
  "F", 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0,
  "F", 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 
  "F", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  "G", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
  "G", 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0,
  "G", 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 
  "G", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
)

brick_colors <- tibble::tribble(
  ~`.value`, ~Color,
  1, "Bright green",
  2, "Dark orange",
  3, "Dark green"
)
  
tree_or_mushroom %>% 
  bricks_from_table(brick_colors) %>% 
  build_bricks(theta = 210, phi = 20, brick_res = "hd")

rayshader::render_snapshot(clear = TRUE)
```

### Plates instead of bricks

That's clearly a tree, right? Why is the data frame called 'tree_or_mushroom'?

Use the input 'brick_type="plate"' to render the 3D model using LEGO plates rather than bricks, which are 1/3 as tall.

```{r bricks_5a, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
brick_colors <- tibble::tribble(
  ~`.value`, ~Color,
  1, "Dark green",
  2, "Light nougat",
  3, "Bright red"
)
  
tree_or_mushroom %>% 
  bricks_from_table(brick_colors) %>% 
  build_bricks(theta = 210, phi = 10, brick_res = "hd", brick_type="plate")

rayshader::render_snapshot(clear = TRUE)
```

## Bricks from Excel

When designing larger models, it is much easier to use a spreadsheet program to lay out the bricks for each level.  

See [the brickr toybox](https://github.com/ryantimpe/brickr_toybox) GitHub repo for some examples and templates.
