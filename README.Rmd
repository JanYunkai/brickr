## Overview
**brickr** is a package for creating LEGO-esque 2D and 3D models using the R [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall)'s [rayshader](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader) package.

The package has two key uses: 
  - Converting image files in to 2D and 3D LEGO mosaics
  - Building 3D LEGO models from simple data frames

## Installation
``` r
# To install the latest version from Github:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ryantimpe/brickr")
```

## Mosaics

The mosaic functions renders an imported JPG or PNG file using LEGO colors and bricks. The resulting mosaic can be viewed in 2D and 3D. A full explanation can be found on [this blog post](http://www.ryantimpe.com/post/lego-mosaic1/), this [follow-up post](http://www.ryantimpe.com/post/lego-mosaic2/),and this [third post](http://www.ryantimpe.com/post/lego-mosaic3/).

```{r m1_set, fig.width = 3, fig.height=3, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mosaic1 <- jpeg::readJPEG("Images/goldengirls.jpg") %>% 
  image_to_bricks(img_size = 48) #Length of each side of mosaic in "bricks"

#Plot 2D mosaic
mosaic1 %>% display_set()
```
If you had previously created mosaics before the package release, the script below will still work.
```{r m1_set2, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
mosaic1 <- jpeg::readJPEG("Images/goldengirls.jpg") %>% 
  scale_image(img_size = 48) %>% #Length of each side of mosaic in "bricks"
  legoize() %>%  
  collect_bricks()
```

### 2D Mosaics

`image_to_bricks()` can take a few important arguments:

- `img_size` Providing a single value, such as `48`, crops the image to a square. Inputting a 2-element array, `c(56, 48)`, will output a rectangular image of `c(width, height)`. 

- `color_table` Data frame of possible brick colors in the mosaic. Defaults to the included data set `lego_colors`.

- `brightness` adjusts the light of the image. Values greater than 1 will lighten the image, while value less than 1 will darken it.

`display_set()` creates a ggplot of the image.

### 3D Mosaics

Two additional functions can convert the `image_to_bricks()` output into a 3D mosaic using the [rayshader](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader) package by [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall).

- `collect_3d()` translates the 2D LEGO mosaic into two matrices - one for the color image and one for the elevation of each point on the image. By default, the produced image has the height of 6 LEGO plates (2 LEGO bricks) with lighter colors having a higher elevation. Use `mosaic_height` to change the height of the mosaic and set `highest_el = 'dark'` to set the darker colors as the tallest bricks.

- `display_3d()` simply calls `rayshader::plot_3d()`, but pulls both the hillshade and elevation matrices from the output of `collect_3d()` and fixes some of the arguments. See `?rayshader::plot_3d()` for more information.

```{r m1_3d, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rayshader)

mosaic1 %>% 
  collect_3d() %>% 
  display_3d(fov=0,theta=-20,phi=30,windowsize=c(1000,800),zoom=0.7)

render_snapshot()
```

## LEGO Mosaics IRL

Additional functions assist in the translation from the LEGO mosaic image into a real LEGO set.

### Instructions

Use `generate_instructions()` to break the LEGO mosaic image into easier-to-read steps for building the set. This defaults to 6 steps, but passing any integer value will generate that many steps.

```{r m1_instructions, fig.width = 8, fig.height=7, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mosaic1 %>% generate_instructions(9)
```

### Piece list and count

Use `display_pieces()` to generate a graphic and count of all required plates or bricks (for stacked mosaics). These are sorted by color and size for easy purchase on LEGO.com's [Pick-a-Brick](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Pick-a-Brick) section using the advanced search option. Alternatively, use `table_pieces()` to produce a data frame table of all required bricks.

```{r m1_pieces, fig.width = 9, fig.height=9, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mosaic1 %>% display_pieces()
```
